  title: Letter from Christ
  content: "Ben,\r\nI have been stuck at the safe house for days now. I am awfully
    hurt and it is much more safe here since the infected can\u2019t enter the house.
    Trix is helping me deliver this to you, you should come with her here, we need
    to leave this place. Ashley has the key to the North Gate, you and Trix need
    to stop by her house to get it. She works for the store in the parking lot.\r\nChrist\r"
